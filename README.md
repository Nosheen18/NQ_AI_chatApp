   - Designed and implemented a responsive user interface using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to ensure a seamless and visually appealing user experience.
   - Created an intuitive chat layout with input fields, message display areas, and styled components tailored for a modern Gen Z audience.

2. **Backend Development:**
   - Developed server-side logic using **Node.js** and **Express.js** to handle API requests and manage chat functionality.
   - Integrated **OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo API** for generating intelligent and contextually accurate conversational responses.

3. **API Integration:**
   - Established secure and efficient communication between the backend server and OpenAI's API.
   - Utilized the `dotenv` package to manage environment variables, safeguarding sensitive credentials such as the OpenAI API key.

4. **Error Handling and Debugging:**
   - Implemented robust error-handling mechanisms to ensure a reliable user experience, even during network failures or API issues.
   - Logged detailed errors for debugging purposes and optimized API call handling for performance.

5. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):**
   - Configured **CORS** to allow secure and seamless communication across platforms.

6. **Version Control:**
   - Utilized **Git** and **GitHub** for version control, maintaining an organized and collaborative workflow.

7. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Conducted extensive testing of the application to ensure functionality, responsiveness, and reliability across various browsers and devices.
